Development goes slow but it goes forward. The main stuff is done. Now there is a lot of styling and adding new stuff. I'm quite new to next.js, but I think at the moment it's the best framework I can build on.

I'm getting better and better each time I'm trying to do something.

Next steps are getting informations from wax network.
