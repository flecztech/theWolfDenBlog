I hope every wolf had a great Christmas. Sorry for the lack of absence lately. I had a lot on my plate those last few months. Still a few to go, but it's all good. A month or two, and I should have way more time. 



I have some days off now, so a few small announcements before new year hits:



Progress on the website was a bit slower than I would have liked. I was mostly working on the token section whenever I had time. The section is nearly finished now. Just a few more touches. There's not a lot left for the first test version. So stay tuned for that.


Small summary of what you can do on the website.

Wolf Den Stuff:
* read news, announcements and future changelogs
Taco:

* check all of our venue stats
* top 100 venues list with some information
* our weekly volunteers brigade leaderboards for last two weeks
Novopangea:

* some world stats like instant upgrades used
* district leaderbords with district information
Wallet:

* view balance and resources

* your wallet tokens chart
* transferring tokens 



Most importantly, all the rewards from last week will be resolved tomorrow. There will be some changes to how the venue redistribute those from next year. The weekly leaderboard will stay the same and not change at all. Venue tax redistribution from the beginning of the year will be done once a month and only have a one-week contribution till a new system is in place. The new system will have job thresholds that you as a worker need to achieve for more shing. This way, volunteers that work more will get more. Not only the top 3 wolves. Also, Top Wolf will get 5 entries instead of the current 2 for every giveaway.
